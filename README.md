Revenue Trend Over Time
Strong seasonal spikes observed in December, particularly in 2010 and 2011
Highest daily revenue recorded on 8 December 2011
Sales typically dip early in the year and rise sharply towards Q4
A 3-month forecast predicts revenue remaining above average (£2,500–£3,500)

Order Volume Trends
Orders peak consistently in December
Notable surge between September and December 2010
Highest order count observed in December 2011
Periods of stability observed during mid-year months

CPI (Inflation) vs Revenue
Scatter analysis shows a positive relationship
As average CPI increases, retail revenue also rises, suggesting price-level effects did not suppress demand during this period

Public Holidays Impact
Weekly revenue comparisons between holiday vs non-holiday weeks
Overall public holidays did not strongly impact revenue except for:
Easter period (Weeks 11–14)
Late-year holiday weeks (Weeks 46 and 48)
